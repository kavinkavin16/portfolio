            <p>Welcome to my portfolio, where creativity meets procrastination! Currently, it's a bit like a DIY project â€“ the ideas are there, but the execution is still in the 'coming soon' phase. However, fear not! While you're here, let me entertain you with a sneak peek into my Linux CLI Kinod Version 1 showcase â€“ because why not start with the coolest stuff first?</p>
            <p>But hey, if you're itching for more (and let's be real, who isn't?), hop on over to my Naukrin and LinkedIn profiles for a rollercoaster ride through the twists and turns of my professional journey. Trust me, it's a wild ride you won't want to miss! Plus, it's a great way to procrastinate... I mean, learn more about me. Go ahead, click those links â€“ you know you want to! ðŸš€</p>
